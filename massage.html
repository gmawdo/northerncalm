			            <p class="bodytext2">
							I practice deep tissue style massage with integrated skills from acupressure points: a technique that stimulates changes with the nervous system to bring release from tension, easing pain and creating lasting physical change. <br/><br/>
							
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							With a specific interest in relieving neck, shoulder and back pain, I also incorporate knowledge and skills relating to reflexology, Alexander Technique, sports injury and nutrition to provide a complete therapeutic solution for the body.<br/><br/>
							
						</p>
						
						<p class="bodytext2">
							Individual massages work well when combined with regular yoga sessions.<br/><br/>
						</p>

						<p class="bodytext2">
							"After having headaches for several months I decided to seek help. To my amazement I no longer have head aches and as an added bonus, sorted a problem I had in my hand, during the same session!"<br/><br/>
						</p>

						<p class="bodytext2">
							"I've had pain in the lower back for some time, sometimes needing time off work when it completely goes. Two days after the first session I realised that I no longer had pain. I now have a monthly treatment which helps me to feel relaxed and loosens me up…”  <br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							Cost: £35 per 1 x hour session<br/><br/>

				           Infant Massage
			            </h3>	<br/>
			            <p class="bodytext2">
							Teaching parents how to massage infants is hugely enjoyable and helps encourage closeness and nurturing. Massage can help reduce problems associated with colic, as well as improving circulation and reinforcing movement reflexes in little ones.  <br/><br/>							
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							Research indicates that infant massage can also act as a primary intervention for post natal depression by improving parent and baby bonding which isn’t always immediate due to such things as difficult births, lack of sleep, stress and the challenges of new responsibilities.<br/><br/>

						<p class="bodytext2">
							Course price: £165<br/><br/>

						<p class="bodytext2">
							Course covers 5 x weekly 1 hour sessions. Cost includes a special organic welcome baby pack and all notes. <br/><br/>
