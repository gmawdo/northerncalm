				           About Me
			            </h3>	<br/>

						<p class="bodytext2">
							For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by physical movement. Having poor eyesight meant that I would recognise people by the way they moved, rather than their faces.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							I began practising yoga in my teens and immediately felt the benefits upon my physical and mental well being. I also realised that it was helping me develop a clearer, calmer perspective on life: something that remains with me today.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							During my twenties, and after seeing both my parents struggle with chronic back pain, it quickly became apparent that my chosen field of market research wasn’t for me. I felt I could do something to help others and decided to start training as a massage therapist. <br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							Based on my personal experiences of yoga, I soon decided not just to follow physical therapy but also explore techniques for mental and emotional well being in the belief that the whole self needs to be considered, rather than each element being treated in isolation. This lead to a further exploration of the fields of yoga and mental relaxation which, in combination with massage, I felt could provide a more complete therapy solution.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							Today, I run a thriving business providing individual one-on-one massage and yoga sessions as well as group sessions. Classes cater for all ages and abilities. In addition, there’s a ‘men only’ group that is specifically tailored to the male physique.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="bodytext2">
							My presentation of teaching is led by example, using visual imagery and simple direction. Sessions are relaxed, honest and above all enjoyable - a fun sense of humour helps invoke a sense of lightness. <br/><br/>
